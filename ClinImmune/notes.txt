TODO:

Fix custom user profile model
Test all API endpoints, or just write tests

--New
Improve error messages of REST interface, and include rest schema in error
messages

Add Docstring for all rest classes for information about what each request
returns.

Check each dict method of spaces instead of underscores

Also, see how django forms handles dictionaries so that ','.join(patients) is
not required in the views, and "DPB1*01:02,DRB1*09:02".split(",")
