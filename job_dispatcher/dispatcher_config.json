		"This JSON document serves as a configuration file for systems administrators. It is important to note that JSON is a rigid format, so all documentation will be done in this comments array. For more information, please refer to http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt or http://gun.io/blog/multi-line-strings-in-json/ . Formatting comments aside, this file has two primary keys: configuration and workgroups. The configuration key servers as a pointer to an object which will hold all configuration parameters for the job dispatcher. All messages passed between servers will be over some a specified transport layer, which is declared in the protocol value. A host, or less formally and address, will define which where the dispatching server can be accessed. Finally, a port should be defined for all transmissions. The workgroups key points to an array of workgroup objects. These objects are defined in a similar way above, but they receive messages about which workgroup should execute the next task. The default values are defined as below",
